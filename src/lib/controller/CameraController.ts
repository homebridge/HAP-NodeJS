 *
 * Before recording is considered enabled two things must happen:
 * - Recording must be enabled by the user. Signaled through {@link updateRecordingActive}.
 * - Recording configurations must be selected by a HomeKit controller through {@link updateRecordingConfiguration}.
 *
 * A typical recording event scenario happens as follows:
 * - The camera is in idle mode, maintaining the prebuffer (the duration of the prebuffer depends on the selected {@link CameraRecordingConfiguration}).
 * - A recording event is triggered (e.g. motion or doorbell button press) and the camera signals it through
 *   the respective characteristics (e.g. {@link Characteristic.MotionDetected} or {@link Characteristic.ProgrammableSwitchEvent}).
 *   Further, the camera saves the content of the prebuffer and starts recording the video.
 *   The camera should continue to store the recording until it runs out of space.
 *   In any case the camera should preserve recordings which are nearest to the triggered event.
 *   A stored recording might be completely deleted if a stream request wasn't initiated for eight seconds.
 * - A HomeKit Controller will open a new recording session to download the next recording.
 *   This results in a call to {@link handleRecordingStreamRequest}.
 * - Once the recording event is finished the camera will reset the state accordingly
 *   (e.g. in the {@link Service.MotionSensor} or {@link Service.Doorbell} service).
 *   It will continue to send the remaining fragments of the currently ongoing recording stream request.
 * - The camera will either reach the end of the recording (and signal this via {@link RecordingPacket.isLast}. Also see {@link acknowledgeStream})
 *   or it will continue to stream til the HomeKit Controller closes
 *   the stream {@link closeRecordingStream} with reason {@link HDSProtocolSpecificErrorReason.NORMAL}.
 * - The camera goes back into idle mode.

   * - Closed by the Accessory: There are no further fragments to transmit. The delegate MUST signal this by setting {@link RecordingPacket.isLast}

   *   the successful transmission.
   * - Closed by the HomeKit Controller (expectedly): After the event trigger has been reset, the accessory continues to stream fragments.
   *   At some point the HomeKit Controller will decide to shut down the stream by calling {@link closeRecordingStream} with a reason
   *   of {@link HDSProtocolSpecificErrorReason.NORMAL}.
   * - Closed by the HomeKit Controller (unexpectedly): A HomeKit Controller might at any point decide to close a recording stream
   *   if it encounters erroneous state. This is signaled by a call to {@link closeRecordingStream} with the respective reason.
   *
   * Once a close of stream is signaled, the `AsyncGenerator` function must return gracefully.
