# HAP-NodeJS

HAP-NodeJS is a Node.js implementation of the HomeKit Accessory Server.

With this project, you should be able to create your own HomeKit Accessory on
a Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison, or any other platform that can run Node.js :)

The implementation may not 100% follow the HAP MFi Specification since the MFi
program doesn't allow individual developers to join.

Remember to run `yarn`/`npm install` before actually running the server.

Users can define their own accessories in: `accessories/[name]_accessory.ts`
files, where `[name]` is a short description of the accessory. All defined
accessories get loaded on server start. You can define accessories using an
object literal notation (see [`Fan_accessory.ts`](src/accessories/Fan_accessory.ts)
for an example) or you can use the API (see below).

You can use the following command to start the HAP Server in Bridged mode:

```sh
ts-node --files src/BridgedCore.ts
```

Or, if you wish to host each Accessory as an independent HomeKit device:

```sh
ts-node --files src/Core.ts
```

The HAP-NodeJS library uses the [`debug`][link-lib-debug] library for log output.
You can print some or all of the logs by setting the `DEBUG` environment
variable. For instance, to see all debug logs while running the server:

```sh
DEBUG=* ts-node --files src/BridgedCore.ts
```
