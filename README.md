# HAP-NodeJS

[![MIT Licensed][icon-license]][link-license]
[![NPM version][icon-npm]][link-npm]

HAP-NodeJS is a Node.js implementation of the HomeKit Accessory Server.

With this project, you should be able to create your own HomeKit Accessory on
a Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison, or any other platform that can run Node.js ðŸ˜ƒ

The implementation may not 100% follow the HAP MFi Specification since the MFi
program doesn't allow individual developers to join.

## Setting up the project

Run the following commands to clone the project, install all dependencies and
compile the Typescript sources to Javascript.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS
cd HAP-NodeJS
```

Then depending on which package manager you use, run the following:

```bash
yarn
yarn build
```

OR

```bash
npm install && npm install --only=dev
npm run build
```

You can use the following command to start the HAP Server in Bridged mode:

```bash
node dist/BridgedCore.ts
```

Or, if you wish to host each Accessory as an independent HomeKit device:

```bash
node dist/Core.ts
```

The HAP-NodeJS library uses the [`debug`][link-lib-debug] library for log
output. You can print some or all of the logs by setting the `DEBUG` environment
variable. For instance, to see all debug logs while running the server:

```bash
DEBUG=* node dist/BridgedCore.ts
```

## Notes

Special thanks to [Alex Skalozub][link-alex-skalozub], who reverse-engineered
the server side HAP. ~~You can find his research [here][link-homekit-research]
.~~ (Sadly, on Nov 4, Apple sent the [DMCA][link-apple-dmca] request to Github
to remove the research.)

[There](http://instagram.com/p/t4cPlcDksQ/) is a video demo running this project
on Intel Edison.
