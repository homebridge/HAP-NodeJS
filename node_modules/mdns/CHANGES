Version 0.0.3 to 0.0.4

   - New service type objects:
     The strings have been replaced with a small ServiceType object. Also, older
     versions used TCP as the default protocol. The protocol is now mandatory.
     However, the new syntax is much more flexible. See user guide at
     http://agnat.github.com/node_mdns/user_guide.html#service_types.

   - The 'info' object is now called 'service'

   - The info.regtype property is now called service.type

   - The info.serviceName property is now called service.name

   - Callback signature changed:
     flags is now a property of the service object (service.flags)

   - possibly more
